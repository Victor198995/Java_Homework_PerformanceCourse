Task 1.
In a given array of integers nums swap values of the first and the last array
elements, the second and the penultimate etc., if the two exchanged values
are even.
Example,
{10, 5, 3, 4} => {4, 5, 3, 10}
{100, 2, 3, 4, 5} => {100, 4, 3, 2, 5}
{100, 2, 3, 45, 33, 8, 4, 54} => {54, 4, 3, 45, 33, 8, 2, 100}

Task 2.
In a given array of integers nums calculate integer result value, that is
equal to the distance between the first and the last entry of the maximum
value in the array.
Example,
{4, 100, 3, 4} result = 0
{5, 50, 50, 4, 5} result = 1
{5, 350, 350, 4, 350} result = 3
{10, 10, 10, 10, 10} result = 4

Task 3.
In a predetermined two-dimensional integer array (square matrix) matrix
insert 0 into elements to the left side of the main diagonal, and 1 into
elements to the right side of the diagonal.
Example,
{{2, 4, 3, 3},                 {{2, 1, 1, 1},
 {5, 7, 8, 5},        =>        {0, 7, 1, 1},
 {2, 4, 3, 3},                  {0, 0, 3, 1},
 {5, 7, 8, 5}}                  {0, 0, 0, 5}}
