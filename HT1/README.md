Task 1:
For a given integer n calculate the value which is equal to a:
• squared number, if its value is strictly positive;
• modulus of a number, if its value is strictly negative;
• zero, if the integer n is zero.
Example,
n = 4 result = 16
n = -5 result = 5
n = 0 result = 0

Task 2.
Find the maximum integer, that can be obtained by permutation of
numbers of an arbitrary three-digit positive integer n (100<=n<=999).
Example,
n = 165 result = 651

* To solve task as in the example

Example of task solution in autocode.
Task. Find the sum of given integer values of a and b.
1. Download skeleton code from our cloned repository to solve the task:

// Implement code according to description of task x
public static int taskX(int a, int b) {
    //TODO: Delete line below and write your own solution
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}

2. Change the skeleton code and put it into our repository:

public static int taskX(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    return result;
}

Assume, that a and b values are already set, and assigning new values to them is an error.
The results should be stored in an integer variable, for example result, and complete your code with
an operator return result;
